> _Just along for the ride._

Driftwood is a deliberately useless browser built for those who love chaos, slowness, and the occasional broken website. It doesn’t try to load the internet — it **floats** near it.

- **Lost-In-The-Web Mode**: no back button. no history. no regrets.
- **Dark Mode Only**: because light mode is too ambitious.
