# Driftwood Browser

> _Just along for the ride._

Driftwood is a deliberately useless browser built for those who love chaos, slowness, and the occasional broken website. It doesn’t try to load the internet — it **floats** near it.

## Features

- **Lazy-Load**: but like, _really_ lazy.  
- **Lost-In-The-Web Mode**: no back button. no history. no regrets.  
- **BreezeCache™**: everything gets deleted every 7 seconds.  
- **Dark Mode Only**: because light mode is too ambitious.  
- **Beachball Tab Rendering**: every tab spins like a tropical vacation.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 (kinda)
- CSS (floats only)
- JS (almost works)
- Duct tape
